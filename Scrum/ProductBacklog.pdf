1. 
As a tester, I want a playable console-based version of our Poker Model for the Game Class, so that when testing the full game before connecting to the View, we can assess which features are working correctly and which are not.
Time Estimate: 4hrs

2.
As a programmer, I want to implement a working game inside of PokerController based off of the implementation of our console-based game, so that we can have a working GUI-Based game.
Time Estimate: 3hrs

3.
As a designer, I want the interface for our game implemented, so that when making our console-based version of our game, we can have the design of our game already completed.
Time Estimate: 5hrs.

4.
As a programmer, I want the CardUtility Class implemented, so that we can have methods to check whether a given hand of cards is a certain type of hand or not.
Time Estimate: 5hrs

5.
As a programmer, I want the code of our Model Classes refactored and optimized so that I can read and alter it more easily for further implementation.

Time Estimate: 1.5hrs

As a programmer, I want to implement a compareTo method for all Hand-based objects, so that we can not only compare each hand with others of the same type to see which hand is better, but also between hands of different types.
Time Estimate: 3hrs

As a programmer, I want to implement all Hand-based objects, so that we can have different objects to represent each type of hand a player may have.
